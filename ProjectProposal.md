# Quantum Computing

Byron Wasti

## Description Of Project

Quantum computing is supposedly the future of computing, and for good reason. It touts the 
ability to solve extremely complex problems in a fraction of the time it would take a standard computer. This has a lot of consequences, including the ability to easily crack many standard encryption techniques that are in use today.

This project will look into what exactly quantum computing is, and try to draw parallels between quantum computing and normal computing. Things such as the qubit being the parallel to the bit, and quantum gates in comparison to normal gates. Understanding how quantum computers function, and their basic building blocks will be the first portion of this project.

The second portion of the project is looking into the societal implications of quantum computing. What happens when people can easily crack most forms of encryption, and what can we do to develop encryption techniques that are quantum-proof? How can quantum computing be applied to things such as protein structure generation, or even circuit layout? There are many implications of having a computer that can look at trillions of solutions at once, and this project will explore some of those ideas.

## Deliverables
### Minimum (MVP)
The MVP for this project is a description of the basic building blocks of quantum computing.

### Planned
A simulation of a Quantum Computer that runs on a classical computer.

### Stretch
Implement the simulation with all necessary gates to do any arbitrary Quantum computation.

## Work Plan
Since there are essentially two sections to this project, they will be broken down into two separate subprojects each a week long.

#### Week 1: Understanding Quantum Computing

| Objective | Time Required | Deliverable |
|:---------------------- | :-----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Understand Qubits | 2 Hours | A written section, with potential diagrams, explaining a qubit and different implementations of a qubit. |
|--------------------|
| Basic quantum logic gates | 8 Hours | A written section explaining the various quantum logic gates and how they compare to their normal counterparts (if they have a normal counterpart) |
|--------------------|
| How things fit together | 2 Hours | A write up of the way different gates interact with each other, including diagrams. |

#### Week 2: Quantum Computer Simulation

| Objective | Time Required | Deliverable |
|:---------------------- | :-----------: | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Implement Qubit | 2-3 Hours | Figure out correct way to represent Qubit states |
|--------------------|
| Implement Standard 1 Qubit gates | 4 Hours | X, Y, Z and Hadamard |
|--------------------|
| Implement CNOT gate | 4 Hours | Have an implementation that correctly keeps track of entanglement |
