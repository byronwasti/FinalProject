# Quantum Computing

Byron Wasti

## Description Of Project

Quantum computing is supposedly the future of computing, and for good reason. It touts the 
ability to solve extremely complex problems in a fraction of the time it would take a standard computer. This has a lot of consequences, including the ability to easily crack many standard encryption techniques that are in use today.

This project will look into what exactly quantum computing is, and try to draw parallels between quantum computing and normal computing. Things such as the qubit being the parallel to the bit, and quantum gates in comparison to normal gates. Understanding how quantum computers function, and their basic building blocks will be the first portion of this project.

The second portion of the project is looking into the societal implications of quantum computing. What happens when people can easily crack most forms of encryption, and what can we do to develop encryption techniques that are quantum-proof? How can quantum computing be applied to things such as protein structure generation, or even circuit layout? There are many implications of having a computer that can look at trillions of solutions at once, and this project will explore some of those ideas.

## Deliverables
### Minimum (MVP)
The MVP for this project is a description of the basic building blocks of quantum computing, and an in-depth analysis of the impacts quantum computing will have on our society.

### Planned
Additional descriptions of how the different building blocks come together to form different computational units, such as the ALU or the memory unit.

### Stretch
Have a diagram of how a quantum computer all fits together. Basically the single-cycle CPU of the quantum computing world.

## Work Plan
Since there are essentially two sections to this project, they will be broken down into two separate subprojects each a week long.

#### Week 1: Understanding Quantum Computing

| Objective | Time Required | Deliverable |
|:--------- | :-----------: | :---------- |
| Understand Qubits | 2 Hours | A written section, with potential diagrams, explaining a qubit and different implementations of a qubit. |
| Basic quantum logic gates | 8 Hours | A written section explaining the various quantum logic gates and how they compare to their normal counterparts (if they have a normal counterpart) |
| How things fit together | 2 Hours | A write up of the way different gates interact with each other, including diagrams. |

#### Week 2: The impacts of Quantum Computing

| Objective | Time Required | Deliverable |
|:--------- | :-----------: | :---------- |
| Get a Good Idea of the General Impacts | 2-3 Hours | A list of potential impacts that I can do a deep dive on |
| Cryptography Impacts | 4 Hours | A written section on how quantum computing affects the world of cryptography. |
| Health/Medical Impacts | 4 Hours | A written section on how quantum computing can help with the world of protein structure finding, and other medical sciences.|
